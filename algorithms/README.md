# Algorithm Zone

How we work?

1. Each week, a moderator will be chosen to:

- create two or three problems (can be taken from Leetcode, Timus, SPOJ or any competitive programing site).
- categorize problems by levels
- summarize output (solutions + code)
- choose the new moderator

2. The rest will have to:

- submit code and peer-review (create a PR to this repo under `algorithms/solutions/` folder)
- only submit solution after **3 days**, do not ask for solution before you show something to prove that you have done your homework

3. For people who does not follow the rule, they will have to pay 200000 VND (or
   10 USD) to the admin (using [paypal](https://paypal.me/hieuk09)). The penalty is for people who:

- don't summit any solutions in one week **OR**
- don't join any discussion
